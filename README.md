# Safe diary
## Goal
Creating a diary app for a university class with two of my friends, who provided the backend. The app integrates face detection (on mobile) and recognition (on backend) for login purposes and speech recognition to match the 'vibe' of writing a diary - putting thoughts on paper.
## Architecture and tools
*  Jetpack Compose to create a modern but simple UI
*  MVVM with separated presentation and domain layers
*  Koin framework to perform dependency injection across the whole app
*  Kotlin Coroutines to achieve concurrency and multithreading
*  Ktor for communication with the server
*  MLKit for face detection
*  SpeechRecognizer API for speech recognition
